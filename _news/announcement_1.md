Following up last years <a href="/_news/announcement_2">Ludicrous paper</a>, we are delighted to have another full paper accepted to ACM CHI 2025 in Yokohama, on the perception of rotational and translational gain in VR in both a motorised simulator chair and moving car on real roads [1].


Across two studies we measured the barely perceivable level of rotational gain as well as the maximum comfortable level when being rotated in a YawVR Yaw2 simulator chair – examing the effects of Speed, Turn Angle, Task and Motion Congruence. We then applied what we learned to a third study where car passengers experienced an ‘unbounded’ VR spaceship game where the real car turns and speed were amplified by 3-10x and we measured perception of any mismatch.

We found that the barely perceivable gain level was ~4x the real rotation, the maximum comfortable gain was a massive 14-17x real rotation, and participants are largely unable to tell when the real and virtual motion are in opposite directions. The results and our guidelines show how passive motion scenarios – such as simulators, gaming chairs, rollercoasters and vehicular XR – can greatly amplify the perceived amount of virtual motion, decoupling physical and virtual movement to provide a wider range of experiences.
