  abstract = {Immersive technologies allow us to personalize our reality while traveling; however, widespread adoption remains limited. This study investigates the challenges of adopting immersive devices in transit, particularly when passengers encounter               asymmetric experiences               using disparate devices. These situations arise as co-located passengers adopt devices with varying levels of immersion, environmental information, and interactive capabilities. Using an enactment methodology in a transit scenario involving disparate devices, our study (N=21) reveals that asymmetric passenger experiences create a sense of disconnection among passengers, especially with varying device immersion capabilities. When interactions require more than a basic response, for example complex verbal exchanges relying on social cues like gaze, adoption is further hindered. The incorporation of cues from reality addresses safety concerns but requires further refinement to support interactions that require complex or extended user involvement. This research advances the understanding of asymmetric passenger dynamics, contributing to the design of immersive technologies for transit settings.},

  abstract = {Electrotactile stimulation is a novel form of haptic feedback. There is little work investigating its basic design parameters and how they create effective tactile cues. This paper describes two experiments that extend our knowledge of two key parameters. The first investigated the combination of pulse width and amplitude (Intensity) on sensations of urgency, annoyance, valence and arousal. Results showed significant effects: increasing Intensity caused higher ratings of urgency, annoyance and arousal but reduced valence. We established clear levels for differentiating each sensation. A second study then investigated Intensity and Pulse Frequency to find out how many distinguishable levels could be perceived. Results showed that both Intensity and Pulse Frequency significantly affected perception, with four distinguishable levels of Intensity and two of Pulse Frequency. These results add significant new knowledge about the parameter space of electrotactile cue design and help designers select suitable properties to use when creating electrotactile cues.},
