# Dr. Julie Williamson

I am a Lecturer in Human Computer Interaction at the University of Glasgow. My research focuses on how people use technology in public spaces and how interactive technologies can be designed given the “performative” aspects of using technology in public. I completed my PhD in Computing Science at the University of Glasgow in January 2012, supervised by Stephen Brewster. I completed my Bachelor of Science Cum Laude in Informatics at the University of California, Irvine.
