I was born in China in 1985. I earned a B.Eng. degree in Communication Engineering from Nanchang Aeronautical University, China, in 2007, an M.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Pusan National University, South Korea, in 2010, and a Ph.D. in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) from Pukyong National University, South Korea, in 2016. Before pursuing Ph.D, I worked in an IoT company, Wiznet, South Korea, engaged in hardware prototyping and firmware development for Ethernet gateway devices. During my Ph.D. studies, I developed a fully wearable, AI-driven BCI system integrated with brain stimulation techniques to detect and mitigate driver drowsiness (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8080143">Paper Link</a>). Following my Ph.D., I pursued postdoctoral training in cognitive neuroscience at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), US (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32286132/">Paper Link</a>) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the University of Glasgow, UK (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11047238">Paper Link</a>). As of August 2024, I am a Lecturer of HCI at the University of Bath, where I am affiliated with the School of Computer Science and the Bath Institute for Augmented Human, UK. My research interests focus on the intersection of VR and BCI for human augmentation, including neuroergonomics and neurorehabilitation. Specific research streams are as follows:

VR-BCI (where BCI can be EEG, fNIRS and DOT-based)
EEG-guided Open/Close-loop Brain Stimulation
Vestibular Neuroscienece (including neural basis of cybersickness/motion sickness)
