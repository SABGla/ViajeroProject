# Katharina Margareta Theresa PÃ¶hlmann

I am an XR researcher with a background in cognitive science and neuroscience focusing on how we can make VR accessible to anyone by reducing or hopefully one day eliminating cybersickness.

My current work focuses on using XR headsets in transport and how these devices can be used to increase comfort and enjoyment and reduce motion sickness in passengers and how we can use multiple sensory cues such as auditory or tactile cues to reduce cybersickness in XR.

I have 5+ years of experience conducting both quantitative and qualitative research focusing on user experience of virtual environments.
